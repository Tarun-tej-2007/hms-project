🏥 Super Awesome Hospital Management System 🏥
"Where C++ meets healthcare, and nobody gets a segmentation fault!"

🚀 What's This All About?
Welcome to the most exciting hospital management system you've ever seen! (Okay, maybe the bar for "exciting hospital software" isn't very high, but we tried our best!)

This C++ application helps healthcare facilities manage their day-to-day operations without pulling their hair out. It's like having a tiny digital army of administrative assistants who never need coffee breaks!

✨ Features That Will Make You Say "Wow!"

Add, update, and track doctors faster than they can say "that's not covered by insurance"
Search by specialization (yes, we know what a "pulmonologist" is!)
Track doctor availability without playing phone tag
🤒 Patient Management
Store patient details more securely than they guard the hospital cafeteria's cookie recipe
Find patients by disease or age range
Track medication histories that are actually readable (unlike doctor handwriting)
📅 Appointment Scheduling
Book appointments with fancy time slots
No more double-bookings (we promise!)
Track appointment statuses - from "scheduled" to "completed" to "ran away screaming"
💊 Medication & Prescriptions
Manage medications without the paper cuts
Create and track prescriptions
Everything is digital - no more deciphering if that's a "5mg" or "50mg"
💰 Billing System
Generate bills that make sense (a revolutionary concept in healthcare!)
Track payment statuses
Calculate revenue without needing an accounting degree
👮 User Authentication
Role-based access control (because not everyone should be able to diagnose patients from the accounting department)
Secure login system (no, the password isn't "password123")

Comprehensive logging system that catches everything except your coffee spills
Financial reporting that will make your accountant smile
